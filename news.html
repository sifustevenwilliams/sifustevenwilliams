<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>

<BR><BR>


Looking back rather than forward for a moment...<BR><BR>
Last year I was interviewed for an article on health and wellbeing for the June edition of <B>The Skinny</B> magazine. The article was published but I was so busy at the time that I never got around to posting a link on the website.<BR><BR>
Well, here at last is a link to the <A HREF="http://issuu.com/theskinny/docs/the_skinny_northwest_issue_15" target="_blank">relevant issue</A> (the article is on page 29).

<BR><BR>

Things have been quiet on the website of late but that hasn't been the case away from it. A lot has happened in three remarkable months.<BR><BR>
<B>In October I returned to China</B> for the unveiling of my Zhan Zhuang and Da Cheng Chuan Grandmaster's memorial in Beijing. This was an important opportunity to show my respect and gratitude, on behalf of both myself and my students, for an extraordinary legacy that has been left to us.
<BR><BR><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="3270.png"> <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="3157.png"><BR><BR><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="3158.png"> <IMG BORDER=1 SRC="3415.png"><BR><BR>
There is also a <A HREF="http://www.lamassociation.org/News___Events/Entries/2014/11/3_Unveiling_of_Professor_Yus_Memorial.html" target="_blank">short video</A> of the event that does a good job of explaining something of the event's significance.<BR><BR>
If you scroll down to October 2013 on this page, you will also find a small tribute that I wrote on the sad news of Grandmaster Yu's passing.<BR><BR>
<B>In November I was in London</B> for the annual training week of Master Lam's senior students and to participate in the association's annual demonstration. A powerful reminder that it is thanks to Master Lam that this art came to the West when it did.
<BR><BR>
<B>In December I travelled to India</B> after being invited to teach Zhan Zhuang over there. I was delighted to see so much interest and enthusiasm for the art and even more happy to see the progress that people made over the course of the week (or even just a few days in some cases) and I'd like to think that Grandmaster Yu would have been very happy too.<BR><BR>
The picture below shows many, but not all, of the people who were there.<BR><BR><IMG WIDTH=850 BORDER=1 SRC="India01.png"><BR><BR>
I hope to return in 2015, so to my new Indian students: please keep training :-)

The news page hasn't been reflecting all that's been going on lately, but I hope to fill in some of those gaps by the end of the year.

One such occasion worthy of more mention was the <b>unveiling of Grandmaster Professor Yu's memorial in Beijing.</B><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF0000>Demonstrations on Saturday 12th and Sunday 13th April</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
<BR><BR>

Once again, I've been too busy to keep up with my website updates  lately but I can announce some more demonstrations this weekend.<BR><BR>
At the <B>Merseyside Maritime Museum, 1:30pm and 2:30pm</B>, we will be performing Wing Chun, Tai Chi and various weapon forms. There will even be a chance to learn a little Tai Chi after the demos. These are free events to be held in the lecture theatre on the fourth floor of the museum.
<BR><BR>
As a consequence of the demonstrations, there will be <B>no Saturday classes this weekend</B> but all are welcome to join us at the demonstrations.
<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
<BR><BR>

Classes will begin again on Monday <B>6th January</B>.<BR><BR>
Although 2013 might look like a quiet year, judging by the news page on this site, it was actually quite a busy one; so much so that I haven't had time to doccument it!<BR><BR> &nbsp &nbsp 
A trip to China,<BR> &nbsp &nbsp A demonstration in China,<BR> &nbsp &nbsp Three public demonstrations in Liverpool (with our friends at the World Martial Arts events),<BR> &nbsp &nbsp Two Zhan Zhuang workshops in Wales,<BR> &nbsp &nbsp The Lam Association annual demo and dinner in London,<BR> &nbsp &nbsp The school's first Christmas dinner in Crosby (which will now hopefully become an annual event)<BR><BR>
That's just some of what we got up to in 2013.<BR><BR>More to come for the new year, already likely to include another demo, a special Wing Chun workshop and maybe another China trip...
<BR><BR>
Meanwhile, I'd like to wish all of my students, both past and present, a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF0000>Sad News...</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3>
<BR><BR>On the 2nd of October, Professor Yu Yong Nian, my Zhan Zhuang Grandmaster (teacher's teacher), passed away.
<BR><BR>

<TABLE><TR>
<TD><IMG BORDER=1 SRC="yu_yong_nian.png" HEIGHT=160></TD>
<TD>&nbsp &nbsp</TD>

<TD>Those who've explored the Health Benefits page of this site will know a little of his pioneering work in introducing Zhan Zhuang into hospitals in China. As an acomplished student of Western medicine, he was able to build the foundations of an important bridge between two, sometimes very different, approaches to healthcare.<BR><BR> He also wrote highly respected books on the subject and encouraged Master Lam to spread it to the world so that as many people as possible could benefit.<BR><BR>I am fortunate that I was able to thank him in person, and also on behalf of my students.<BR></TD></TR></TABLE>
<BR><B>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "This art is for the whole world, don't keep it to yourself"</B>.
<BR><BR>
Dear Grandmaster Yu,<BR><BR>
Thank you so much for what you have done.<BR>
For your dedication in pursuing your art,<BR>
for your wisdom in using it,<BR>
and for your kindness in sharing it.<BR><BR>
We remember your words and your vision:<BR>
with fondness; with admiration; with purpose.<BR><BR>
Forever grateful...

<TD>From <B>19th April</B> there will be a new Monday class:<BR><B>Lam style Tai Chi mini-form</B>.<BR><BR>
Lam style Tai Chi incorporates much of Master Lam's understanding of Zhan Zhuang and so is both complementary to zhan zhuang training and very beneficial in its own right.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<BR>In the coming months there will be extensive site updates to further explain Lam style Tai Chi and its benefits. Meanwhile you can find class details <A HREF="classes.html">here</A>.
